# test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This is a basic Flutter To-Do App.

This does not have a backend part but hive is being used to store the data in the phone and working as a basic db.

This is also using 'slidable' widget to create a cool 'delete' animation.

Everything is a widget.
